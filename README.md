# Molecular-Geometry-Calculator
This tool will allow you to enter the name of a compond and the program will tell you the name of its molecular geometry.

Algorithm:
  Input: Compond/molecule. Example: H2O
  Process: 
    - Ask user for compound/molecule
    - Identify elements present
    - Identify ammount of valance electrons (use electron configuration) per element and the ammount of atoms per element
    - Calculate total valance electrons
    - Calculate Octet electrons 
    - Calculate number of bonds (Oe - Ve)/2
    - Calculate nonebonding electrons
    - Calculate bonding pairs, lone pairs and total electron groups
    - Compare data to known characteristics of electron and molecular geometry
    - Print Molecular and electron geometries
    Output: Molecular and electron geometries
